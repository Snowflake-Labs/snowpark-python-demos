# CI/CD for Machine Learning within Snowflake

Machine Learning (ML) has transformed the way businesses analyze and interpret data. Yet, operationalizing ML models remains a challenge. As datasets grow and environments evolve, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) becomes indispensable. In this demo, I'll showcases how to implement CI/CD for an ML workflow using Snowflake.

This repository contains code to demonstrate end-to-end machine learning development and deployment using Snowflake.

## Repository Structure
1. Data: This folder contains the dataset used in the demo.
2. Source Code: This directory contains all the scripts required for setting up the environment, data loading, data processing, model training, and deployment.
3. Github Actions Code: The files in this directory are used to set up the CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions.
4. Conda Environment: This directory includes a requirements.txt file to set up the necessary Python environment.

## Steps for Running the Project
1. Setup Snowflake Environment: This involves configuring the connection to the Snowflake data warehouse and setting up any required databases, schemas, or other resources.
2. Load Data into Snowflake: In this step, the data present in the Data folder is loaded into the Snowflake data warehouse.
3. Prepare Data for Model Training: The data loaded into Snowflake is preprocessed and prepared for machine learning model training.
4. Train and Deploy Machine Learning Model: Using the processed data, a machine learning model is trained and deployed.
5. Create a Stored Procedure in Snowflake: A stored procedure is created for cleaning and processing data incrementally. This procedure is used for future batch inferences.
6. Orchestrate the Machine Learning Workflow: The entire workflow is orchestrated using Tasks and Streams in Snowflake. This ensures that the process is fully automated and can handle new data as it becomes available.

## How to Use This Repository
To use this repository, clone it to your local machine or development environment. You can then run the scripts in the order specified above.

Ensure that you have set up your Snowflake environment correctly and have the necessary access rights to perform these operations. You also need to set up the Python environment using the requirements.txt file provided in the Conda Environment directory.

This demonstration shows the capabilities of Snowflake in terms of machine learning model development, deployment, and orchestration. You can use it as a basis for developing more complex workflows or for working with different types of data and models.

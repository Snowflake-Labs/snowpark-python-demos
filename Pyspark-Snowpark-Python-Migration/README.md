# Pyspark to Snowpark Python Migration 

### Snowpark for Python
Snowpark enables developers, data scientists, ML engineers, and more to build data processing pipelines using code. Snowpark for Python is a developer framework for Snowflake which provides Snowpark Dataframe API whose constructs are similar to that of Pyspark DataFrame API and Pandas DataFrame queries.

Many people looking to gain the benefits of Snowpark may have existing pipelines built using Spark. Spark is a popular choice for big data processing today. PySpark DataFrame API integrates with Python and Python libraries for running these Spark workloads. This document will cover considerations and best practices when moving from PySpark to Snowpark.
